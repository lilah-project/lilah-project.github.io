LiLaH (The Linguistic Landscape of Hate Speech in Social Media) is an FWO (Flemish NSF) and SSF (Slovenian Sciene Foundation) funded project focusing on building systems that can automatically recognize and analyse hate speech in social media texts. 
We are interested in the linguistic properties of the language that is being used to express hate in social media, specifically hate against migrants and LGBT people, and in automatically detecting it.
