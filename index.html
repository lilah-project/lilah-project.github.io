			<p align="justify">LiLaH (The Linguistic Landscape of Hate Speech in Social Media)
				is an FWO (Flemish NSF) and SSF (Slovenian Sciene Foundation) funded project
				focusing on building systems that can automatically recognize and analyse hate speech in
				social media texts. 
				We are interested in the linguistic properties of the language that is being used to express
				hate in social media, specifically hate against migrants and LGBT people, and in automatically
				detecting it. <!-- The analysis will be on different linguistic levels and different levels 
				of complexity. --> 
				The languages addressed are English, Dutch, Slovene, Croatian and French.</p>
